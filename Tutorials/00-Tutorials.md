# Tutorials

Welcome to the **Tutorials** section! Here you will find miscellanious guides teaching you how to do cool things with your OpenBCI hardware and software. In this section you'll find getting started guides. Some of these tutorials detail how to do more advanced things with the OpenBCI platform. Some of them teach you how to optimize your computer for maximum performance while working with OpenBCI. And others teach you how to connect OpenBCI to other hardware devices.

If you have an idea for a great OpenBCI tutorial, we'd love to hear it! Please [donâ€™t hesitate to reach out](mailto:contact@openbci.com). We'd be happy to help you in the creation of your tutorial. 

You can also, just go ahead and create one without reaching out to us first. Head over to the ["Docs" repo](https://github.com/openbci/docs) of our github account, fork it, add your own XYZ.md file in the "Tutorials" direcory, create your doc, and submit a pull request! It's as easy as that.
