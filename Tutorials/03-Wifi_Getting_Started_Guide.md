# Wifi Getting Started Guide

**[Suggest changes on this page](https://github.com/OpenBCI/Docs/edit/master/Tutorials/03-Wifi_Getting_Started_Guide.md)**

## Overview

Congrats on your new OpenBCI WiFi Shield! The WiFi Shield was produced in a partnership between OpenBCI and Push The World. OpenBCI lended their expertise in prototyping, sourcing, and distribution while [Push The World](www.pushtheworldllc.com) designed the hardware, firmware, drivers and OpenBCI_GUI code. We are excited to provide a device that opens up a whole new world of possibilities.

## Prerequisites

The WiFi Shield requires your Cyton to run the latest [v3.1.0](https://github.com/OpenBCI/OpenBCI_32bit_Library/releases/tag/v3.1.0) firmware and your Ganglion to the latest [v2.0.0](https://github.com/OpenBCI/OpenBCI_Ganglion_Library/releases/tag/v2.0.0) firmware.

**You must update your firmware before getting started.**

* [Updating Cyton Firmware Tutorial](http://docs.openbci.com/Hardware/05-Cyton_Board_Programming_Tutorial#cyton-board-programming-tutorial-overview)
* [Updating Ganglion Firmware](http://docs.openbci.com/Hardware/09-Ganglion_Programming_Tutorial)

This guide will walk you through setting up your WiFi Shield, connecting it to your computer, and then connecting it to yourself. The first tutorial is for the Cyton and the second is for the Ganglion.

## Cyton with WiFi Shield

You only need one battery when using the Cyton with the WiFi Shield. The Cyton takes power from the WiFi Shield. When the Cyton is powered by the WiFi Shield, you'll find the power switch on the Cyton becomes useless.

![OpenBCI Wifi Contents](../assets/images/wifi_what_you_need.jpg)

### What you need

 1. OpenBCI WiFi Shield
 2. OpenBCI Cyton Board **Must have at least [v3.1.0 Cyton firmware](https://github.com/OpenBCI/OpenBCI_32bit_Library/releases/tag/v3.1.0) or newer!** Here is the guide for [uploading new firmware to your Cyton Board](http://docs.openbci.com/Hardware/05-Cyton_Board_Programming_Tutorial).
 3. One LiPo battery or 6V AA battery pack & (x4) AA batteries (batteries not included)

### General Overview

In general the steps are:

 1. Power off WiFi Shield and Cyton
 2. Seat WiFi Shield on Cyton
 3. Put `EXT PWR` switch on Shield to `ON`
 4. Plug battery into WiFi Shield only
 5. Main power switch on WiFi Shield to `ON`

### Powering the Shield

Install 4 AA batteries in your battery pack or charge up your LiPo battery. The Wifi shield has a larger power draw then the Bluetooth communication system so we recommend using LiPo battery packs. You can keep the `EXT PWR` switch `ON` to passthrough power to the Cyton, more on this in the section below titled _Powering the Shield_.

**IMPORTANT! Keep the dip switch labeled `EXT PWR` to `ON` when using Cyton.**

The Wifi Shield and the Cyton board use only one battery by means of the JST connector on the Wifi shield. Passing through power to the Cyton requries having the `EXT PWR` switch in the `ON` position.

![Wifi Power](../assets/images/wifi_battery_connection.jpg)

The pass through LED (the right most LED) on the wifi shield will show the solid blue LED from the Cyton below.

![Wifi Pass Through Power](../assets/images/wifi_pass_through_power.jpg)

Make sure that the external power switch is set to `ON` to send power through to the Cyton board.

![Wifi External Power](../assets/images/wifi_what_you_need.jpg)

The Cyton is not able to supply enough current to power the power-hungry wifi shield, so we put a bigger voltage regulator on the shield to power both the Wifi chip and pass the Cyton components.

## Ganglion with WiFi Shield

### What you need

 1. OpenBCI WiFi Shield
 2. OpenBCI Ganglion Board **IMPORTANT: Must have at least v2.0.0 Ganglion firmware or newer!**
 3. Two batteries, 3.7V or 4.2V LiPo or 6V AA battery will work (batteries not included)

![OpenBCI Wifi Contents](../assets/images/wifi_ganglion_what_you_need.jpg)

### General Overview

In general the steps are:

 1. Power off WiFi Shield and Ganglion
 2. Seat WiFi Shield on Ganglion
 3. Put `EXT PWR` switch on Shield to `OFF`
 4. Plug battery into Ganglion
 5. Plug battery into WiFi Shield
 6. Main power switch on WiFi Shield to `ON`
 5. Main power switch on Ganglion to `ON`

### Powering the Shield

The Ganglion runs at 3 Volts while the WiFi Shield runs at 3.3V. Using the Ganglion to power the WiFi Shield is not recommended. Install 4 AA batteries into your battery packs or charge up your LiPo batteries. The Wifi shield draws more current than the Ganglion so we recommend using LiPo rechargable batteries to power the Wifi Shield.

To use two batteries, keep `EXT PWR` in the `OFF` position, you can use the black spunger tool, that came with your WiFi Shield, to flip the `EXT PWR` switch to `OFF`.

![EXT PWR ON/OFF](../assets/images/wifi_ext_pwr_on_off.jpg)`EXT PWR` is `ON` in top photo, `OFF` in bottom photo.

With two batteries, always power the WiFi Shield before the Ganglion.

![Two batteries for ganglion with wifi shield](../assets/images/wifi_ganglion_power_2.jpg)

On some modules, the Ganglion can power the WiFi Shield using only one battery with `EXT PWR` to `ON`. This method is not recommended but has been shown to work with some devices.

![Battery Connection](../assets/images/wifi_ganglion_power.jpg)

## WiFi Shield Mode of Operations

The release of WiFi Shield firmware v2.0.0 introduced WiFi Direct. WiFi Direct bypasses a WiFi router by having your computing device use WiFi to join the WiFi Shield's hotspot. This allows for really great signal acquisition.

### Status D2 LED Indicator

If the WiFI Shield is not able to join a wireless network, such as when the saved wireless network is not in range or the WiFi shield has no credentials saved in memory, the WiFi will be in WiFi Direct mode. The D2 LED indicator will blink 10 times in 2 seconds to indicate the WiFi Shield is in WiFi Direct mode.

If there are saved wireless network credentials on the WiFi Shield, the WiFi Shield will blink 4 times in 2 seconds to indicate the WiFi Shield is searching for the stored wireless network. If the stored network is found, the WiFi Shield will join the wireless network and blink 2 times in 2 seconds; the WiFi Shield is now in WiFi Station mode. If the stored network is not found within 10 seconds, the WiFi Shield will switch into WiFi Direct mode.

The WiFi Manager, the tool used to store wireless network credentials onto the WiFi shield, may be launched in either WiFi Client mode or WiFi Direct mode.

## Get the WiFi Shield On Your Wireless Network

You want to put the WiFi Shield into WiFi Station mode. Therefore the WiFi Shield must be on the same wireless network as your computer, smart phone, or whatever other internet connected device you wish to talk to the WiFi Shield with. For example, in order to stream data into the OpenBCI GUI using your WiFi Shield, you must first make sure that your WiFi shield and computer that is running the OpenBCI GUI are on the same WiFi network.

Before the WiFi Shield has joined a network, the Shield acts as a WiFi hotspot, and will have a name such as "OpenBCI-A4AD" where the last four digits are hexadecimal and are unique to your WiFi shield.

To connect your WiFi shield to your local WiFi network (or any other WiFi network), use any WiFi-enabled device to connect to the WiFi shield hotspot. Doing this launches the captive touch portal as shown in the screenshots below. The captive touch portal is used to connect your WiFi shield to your local WiFi network (or any other WiFi network) so that it can share data across that network.

**Important Notes Before You Continue:**

* In order to unpair your WiFi Shield with a WiFi network (or update its firmware), it cannot be under control of an OpenBCI Board (Cyton or Ganglion). It needs to be powered separately, with Ganglion, WiFi Shield shall be disconnected, with Cyton, the `EXT PWR` shall be in the off position. Why? So the WiFi Shield can effectively power cycle.
* If you have trouble joining the WiFi Shield network, turn the WiFi of your phone/computer/etc. off/on
* It may take 10-15 seconds for your WiFi shield to appear in your WiFi options (be patient!)
* Once you connect your WiFi shield to a network, it will no longer appear in your WiFi options with its "OpenBCI-XXXX" unique ID. To make it reappear, you must first "ERASE CREDENTIALS" of the WiFi Shield from the WIFI SHIELDS configuration inside the OpenBCI GUI
* The WiFi shield does not work for Enterprise level security. Use your cellphone as a hot spot or set up your own wifi network if this is an issue. Push The World is planning a WiFi direct connection as another alternative for researchers and those on enterprise networks.

Follow the below example that goes through the steps of connecting the WiFi Shield to a local WiFi networked called _MeerketManor_. **Note:** in your case the network will not be called _MeerketManor_ but will instead be the name of whatever WiFi network you wish to connect your WiFi Shield to and share data across.

### Example WiFi Firmware v2.x.x and later

Your local WiFi network is called _MeerketManor_ and it is password protected. You turn on the WiFi on your smartphone and search for WiFi network options. Additionally, your WiFi Shield is connected to a battery and powered on (and not connected to an OpenBCI Board, or if Cyton, `EXT PWR` is OFF). In your iPhone's WiFi network options, you see _MeerketManor_ and "OpenBCI-A4AD" (the last 4 characters will be different in your case).

![iPhone Connected to MeerketManor](../assets/images/wifi_join_network_1.PNG)

You click "OpenBCI-A4AD", in an attempt to connect to the WiFi Shield's hotspot.

**Note:** If there is an issue where it may take several times to bring up the captive touch portal.  Power cycling the board may useful.

![iPhone Connecting to `OpenBCI-A4AD`](../assets/images/wifi_join_network_2.PNG)

After a couple seconds a captive touch portal will appear on the computer, phone or tablet. Click _Configure WiFi_.

![Captive touch portal first screen](../assets/images/wifi_captive_touch_first_screen.PNG)

On the next screen, see that _MeerketManor_ is listed as a possible network for the WiFi Shield to join. Select _MeerketManor_ and enter the password for the network and press _save_.

![Captive touch portal second screen](../assets/images/wifi_captive_touch_second_screen.PNG)

If the _MeerketManor_ password was entered correctly, then the WiFi Shield will join _MeerketManor_ after a quick reboot and every time the network is within range. Have fun streaming your brain waves over WiFi!

**Note:** the OpenBCI WiFi shield cannot be paired with multiple WiFi networks. However, if the WiFi Shield is out of range of the network it is currently paired with, it will reappear as a hotspot again. At this point, if you reconnect to the hotspot and then connect the WiFi Shield to a different WiFi network. The previous network credentials will be overwritten by the new ones.

![Captive touch portal final screen](../assets/images/wifi_captive_touch_final_screen_shot.PNG)

If you are a developer and want to control the WiFi Shield through HTTP commands checkout the [server specifications](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/pushtheworld/openbci-wifi-server/1.3.0)!

### Example Firmware v1.x.x

Your local WiFi network is called _MeerketManor_ and it is password protected. You turn on the WiFi on your smartphone and search for WiFi network options. Additionally, your WiFi Shield is connected to a battery and powered on (and not connected to an OpenBCI Board!). In your iPhone's WiFi network options, you see _MeerketManor_ and "OpenBCI-A4AD" (the last 4 characters will be different in your case).

![iPhone Connected to MeerketManor](../assets/images/wifi_join_network_1.PNG)

You click "OpenBCI-A4AD", in an attempt to launch the captive touch portal.

**Note:** there is a known issue where it may take several times to bring up the captive touch portal. Push The World is actively seeking a better solution, in the meantime, be patient and try multiple times to connect to the board. Power cycling the board may useful.

## Connecting with the OpenBCI GUI

Although the WiFi Shield can be connected to any internet connected device, the OpenBCI_GUI provides a great application to get started!

### Download/Install/Run the OpenBCI GUI

The OpenBCI GUI gained WiFi Shield support as of `v3.0.0` or later.

Please [follow the step by step guide](http://docs.openbci.com/OpenBCI%20Software/01-OpenBCI_GUI) to install the OpenBCI_GUI as a standalone application. WiFi has no prerequisites other then installing the OpenBCI Hub on Windows, on mac and linux, the hub is built into the standalone app.

Come back to this guide when your GUI is running!
