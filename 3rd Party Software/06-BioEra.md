# BioEra

From the BioEra homepage: BioEra is a visual designer useful for analyzing signals in real time. It can be used with any device with ability to stream data to a computer.

BioEra is used to create a design visually. A design represents data flow from input (e.g. biofeedback device) to output (e.g. visual or sound feedback). The flow can be customized with hundreds built-in objects (elements). For example an amplitude of alpha brainwaves can be filtered from input EEG signal, it can then trigger a MIDI, video or a computer task at a certain threshold level. 

## Setting Up Your Environment
