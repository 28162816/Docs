# BrainBay

## Setting Up Your Environment

**Windows:** BrainBay only works with the Windows operating system.

**MacOS and Linux:** If you have Mac OS or Linux, you can use BrainBay through a virtual machine program like VirtualBox. Check out our VirtualBox tutorial [here!](http://docs.openbci.com/Tutorials/12-Win7_VM_Installation)

## Installation

Click on the download link for the lastest version of BrainBay here: (http://www.shifz.org/brainbay/). If you're using a virtual machine, be sure to download and set up BrainBay from within the VM environment.

Click **Setup_BrainBay_v2.1.exe**, or the equivalent .exe for the latest version, and follow the prompts to run the program. When you're finished, a BrainBay icon should appear on your desktop.

## Getting Started

Double-clicking the BrainBay icon will open a demo screen. To learn more about BrainBay's capabilities, click on one of the demo options.
